## Written Report

The analysis shows that even though per-student spending throughout the district fluctuated minimally, the highest performing schools were Charter type schools.

The highest performing school had a very low per-student budget, but had the highest overall passing percentage. The average math scores are all lower than the average reading scores, regardless of performance.
